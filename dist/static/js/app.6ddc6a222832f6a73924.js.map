是基于`Vue2.0`的**桌面端组件库**。\n\n## XCUI的目标是：\n\n+ 满足桌面端页面大部分基础组件需求。\n+ 快速开发基于 `Vue2.0` 构建的项目。\n+ 保持小体积, 无其他js库依赖。\n+ 简洁优雅。\n\n## 组件展示\n\n[XCUI主页](https://wmfe.github.io/xcui/)\n\n## 版本支持\n\n在使用`Vue 2.x` 版本时，推荐使用 `Vue 2.0.8` 以上版本。\n\n\n## 安装\n\n通过`npm`安装，或在[这里](https://github.com/wmfe/xcui/releases)下载打包好的版本：\n\n```bash\nnpm install xcui\n```\n\n\n## 快速上手\n\n`xcui`使用`umd`方式打包，支持各种模块加载器。\n\n在页面根实例中引入：\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport xcui from 'xcui'\nimport 'xcui/dist/xcui.css'\nVue.use(xcui);\n```\n\n或者：\n\n```javascript\nvar Vue = require('vue');\nvar xcui = require('xcui').default;\nVue.use(xcui);\n```\n\n在页面中声明标签，即可使用。\n\n> **说明**\n>

使用`row`在水平方向建立一组`col`\n- 你的内容应该放在`col`内，并且，只有`col`可以作为`row`的直接子元素\n- 栅格系统中`col`的`span`属性表示其跨越的范围，其跨度为 `x / 24 * 100%` , 例如，要对一行进行四等分，可用4个`span`为8的`col`来实现\n- 相加的总和如果大于24，将另起一行排列。\n\n## 基础布局\n\n::: demo 通过使用`row`组件包裹`col`组件，可以很方便地实现布局。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"24\"><div class=\"bg\">24: 100%</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"12\"><div class=\"bg\">12: 50%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"12\"><div class=\"bg light\">12: 50%</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\"><div class=\"bg\">8: 33.33%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\"><div class=\"bg light\">8: 33.33%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\"><div class=\"bg\">8: 33.33%</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"6\"><div class=\"bg\">6: 25%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"6\"><div class=\"bg light\">6: 25%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"6\"><div class=\"bg\">6: 25%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"6\"><div class=\"bg light\">6: 25%</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg\">4: 16.66%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg light\">4: 16.66%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg\">4: 16.66%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg light\">4: 16.66%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg\">4: 16.66%</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg light\">4: 16.66%</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 区块间隔\n\n::: demo 通过设置`gutter`，可以设置区块之间的间隔。建议以`16`的倍数来设置。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row :gutter=\"16\">\n        <x-col :span=\"6\"><div class=\"bg\">col-6</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"6\"><div class=\"bg light\">col-6</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"6\"><div class=\"bg\">col-6</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"6\"><div class=\"bg light\">col-6</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## 左右偏移\n\n::: demo 通过设置`offset`可以将列向右侧偏。例如，`offset=\"8\"` 将元素向右侧偏移了 8 个列（column）的宽度。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\"><div class=\"bg\">col-8</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\" offset=\"8\"><div class=\"bg\">col-8 col-offset-8</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 栅格排序\n\n::: demo 通过使用`push`和`pull`类就可以很容易的改变列（column）的顺序。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"18\" :push=\"6\"><div class=\"bg light\">col-18 col-push-6</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"6\" :pull=\"18\"><div class=\"bg\">col-6 col-pull-18</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n:::\n\n## flex布局 \n\n::: demo 使用`row-flex`定义`flex`布局，其子元素根据不同的值 `start`,`center`,`end`,`space-between`,`space-around`，分别定义其在父节点里面的排版方式。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <p>向左排列</p>\n    <x-row type=\"flex\" justify=\"start\">\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg\">col-4</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg light\">col-4</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg\">col-4</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div class=\"bg light\">col-4</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n    <p>居中排列</p>\n    <x-row type=\"flex\" justify=\"center\">\n        <x-col :span=\"4\"><div

参照`Bootstrap`的[响应式设计](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-media-queries)，预设四个响应尺寸：`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`。调整浏览器的尺寸来看效果。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :xs=\"2\" :sm=\"4\" :md=\"6\" :lg=\"8\"><div class=\"bg\">col</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :xs=\"20\" :sm=\"16\" :md=\"12\" :lg=\"8\"><div class=\"bg light\">col</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :xs=\"2\" :sm=\"4\" :md=\"6\" :lg=\"8\"><div class=\"bg\">col</div></x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 其它属性的响应式\n\n::: demo `span`, `pull`, `push`, `offset`, `order` 属性可以通过内嵌到 `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` 属性中来使用。其中 `xs={6}` 相当于 `xs={ span: 6   }`。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :xs=\"{ span: 5, offset: 1 }\" :lg=\"{ span: 6, offset: 2 }\"><div class=\"bg\">col</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :xs=\"{ span: 11, offset: 1 }\" :lg=\"{ span: 6, offset: 2 }\"><div class=\"bg\">col</div></x-col>\n        <x-col :xs=\"{ span: 5, offset: 1 }\" :lg=\"{ span: 6, offset: 2 }\"><div class=\"bg\">col</div></x-col>\n

`total`, `current-page-num`均为必选参数。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-pagination\n        @change-current=\"goToPage\"\n        :current-page-num=\"num1\"\n        :total=\"total\"\n        :page-size=\"pageSize\">\n    </x-pagination>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                num1: 1,\n                pageSize: 10,\n                total: 100\n            };\n        },\n        methods: {\n            goToPage(pageNo, oldPageNo) {\n                this.num1 = pageNo;\n            }\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n```\n:::\n\n## 标准尺寸下的其他挂件\n\n\n\n::: demo 通过设置`show-sizer`, `show-total`来控制是否显示分页挂件和总页数挂件。`sizer`可用时需要通过`change-pagesize`事件来处理`page-size`。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-pagination\n        show-sizer\n        show-total\n        @change-current=\"goToPage2\"\n        @change-pagesize=\"onChangeSize\"\n        :current-page-num=\"num2\"\n        :total=\"total\"\n

迷你尺寸可以放在元素顶部，或者在页面空间受到限制时使用。设置`type=\"mini\"`即可。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-pagination\n        show-total\n        type=\"mini\"\n        @change-current=\"goToPage\"\n

`Loading`在XCUI中以指令方式调用。如果完整引入了XCUI，可以直接使用`v-loading`指令。\n>  在**单文件引入**时，由于`Loading`在XCUI中被注册为一个[Vue 插件](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html),请使用`Vue.use(Loading)` 挂载，再进行使用。\n\n## 基本使用\n\n::: demo 基本使用，在需要加载中提示的区块元素上设置`v-loading`指令，并绑定`Boolean`即可。默认状况下，Loading 遮罩会插入到绑定元素的子节点，通过添加`body`修饰符，可以使遮罩插入至 `DOM` 中的 `body` 上。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <div v-loading.body=\"loading\" style=\"width: 400px;height: 60px;padding: 30px; outline: 1px dotted #eee;\">\n        <img :src=\"imgPara\">\n    </div>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                loading: true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 其他加载效果\n\n::: demo 除了默认效果外，还可以通过在需要Loading的区块元素上设置`x-loading-type`属性来使用其他两种效果：`grid`和`dot`。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <div v-loading=\"loading\" x-loading-type=\"grid\" style=\"width: 30%;display:inline-block;margin-top: 15px;padding: 30px; outline: 1px dotted #eee;\">\n        <img :src=\"imgPara\">\n    </div>\n\n    <div v-loading=\"loading\" x-loading-type=\"dot\" style=\"width: 30%;display:inline-block;margin-top: 15px;padding: 30px; outline: 1px dotted #eee;\">\n        <img :src=\"imgPara\">\n    </div>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 整页加载\n\n::: demo 当需要全屏遮罩时，可使用`fullscreen`修饰符（此时遮罩会插入至 body 上）。此时若需要锁定屏幕的滚动，可以使用`lock`修饰符。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button type=\"primary\" @click=\"openFullScreen\" v-loading.fullscreen.lock=\"fullscreenLoading\">\n        显示整页加载，3 秒后消失\n    </x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n

XCUI为`Vue.prototype`添加了全局方法`$Message`, 如果您完整引入了XCUI， 可以直接使用如`this.$Message.info('message')`的方式进行信息提示操作。\n> 当然，您也可以使用`import Message from 'xcui/components/message'` 的单组件方式调用。\n> Message在XCUI中被注册为一个[Vue 插件](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html), 在**单文件引入**时，请使用`Vue.use(Message)` 挂载，再进行使用。\n\n\n## 基本使用\n\n::: demo 基本提示，展示信息3s后消失。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button type=\"primary\" @click=\"info\">显示普通提示</x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        methods: {\n            info() {\n                this.$Message.info('这是一条普通提示');\n            }\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 提示类型\n\n::: demo 支持四种方法：`info(信息提示)`， `success(成功提示)`， `warning(警告提示)`，`error（错误提示）`。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button type=\"success\" @click=\"success\">显示成功提示</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"warning\" @click=\"warning\">显示警告提示</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"danger\" @click=\"error\">显示错误提示</x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        methods: {\n            success() {\n                this.$Message.success('这是一条成功提示');\n            },\n            warning() {\n                this.$Message.warning('这是一条警告提示');\n            },\n            error() {\n                this.$Message.error('这是一条错误提示');\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## 自定义时长\n\n::: demo 显示一个10秒的提示。也可以在`Message.config()`中全局配置，详见API。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button type=\"info\" @click=\"delay\">显示10s的提示</x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        methods: {\n            delay() {\n                this.$Message.info('这是一条10秒后关闭的提示', 10000);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 关闭时的回调函数\n\n::: demo 使用关闭时的回调函数。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button type=\"info\" @click=\"callback\">关闭时显示信息</x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        methods: {\n            callback() {\n                this.$Message.warning('此条信息关闭后会显示一条普通信息', 3000, () => {\n                    this.$Message.info('信息关闭了');\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 使用提示\n\n### 单组件使用时，请遵循以下的方式注册`Message`插件。如果已经全局使用`Vue.use(xcui)`, 则无需再次注册。\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue';\n\nimport { Message } from 'xcui/components/message';\n\nVue.use(Message);\n```\n\n## API\n\n通过以下方法来使用：\n\n```javascript\n// 普通提示\nthis.$Message.info(content, duration, onClose);\n\n// 成功提示\nthis.$Message.success(content, duration, onClose);\n\n// 警告提示\nthis.$Message.warning(content, duration, onClose);\n\n// 错误提示\nthis.$Message.error(content, duration, onClose);\n```\n\n| 参数 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 | 是否必选 |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|\n|content|String|无|提示信息内容|必选|\n|duration|Number|3000|自动关闭延时，单位: 毫秒, 默认3000毫秒后自动关闭。设置0则不会自动关闭|可选|\n|onClose|Function|无|关闭后的回调函数|可选|\n\n## 全局配置\n\n可使用`Message.config(options)`来进行全局设置，例如，设置所有的提示都在1s内关闭。\n\n使用`Message.destroy()` 可全局销毁`Message`实例。\n\n```javascript\n// 全局的提示信息距离顶部50px, 1s后关闭\n\nthis.$Message.config({\n    top: 50,\n    duration: 1000\n})\n\n// 销毁`Message`实例\n\nthis.$Message.destroy();\n\n```\n| 参数 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|top|Number|24|提示信息距离页面顶端的距离，单位为像素|\n|duration|Number|3000|自动关闭延时，单位: 毫秒, 默认3000毫秒后自动关闭。设置0则不会自动关闭|\n\n\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                count1: 1,\n                count2: 2,\n                count3: 3,\n                count4: 4\n            };\n        },\n        methods: {\n            info() {\n                this.$Message.info('这是一条普通提示');\n            },\n            success() {\n

XCUI为`Vue.prototype`添加了全局方法`$Notice`, 如果您完整引入了XCUI， 可以直接使用如`this.$Notice.info('some message')`的方式进行通知提示操作。\n> 当然，您也可以使用`import Notice from 'xcui/components/notice'` 的单组件方式调用。\n> Notice在XCUI中被注册为一个[Vue 插件](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html), 在**单文件引入**时，请使用`Vue.use(Notice)` 挂载，再进行使用。\n\n::: demo 基本使用，默认在4.5s后关闭。如果`desc`选项未填，则仅展示标题。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button

}\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 定义元素的显示\n\n::: demo 通过使用`header`, `footer`插槽，`show-header`、`show-footer`等属性都可控制对话框的展示效果。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button @click=\"modal2 = true\">自定义页头和页脚</x-button>\n    <x-button @click=\"modal3 = true\">不带标题栏</x-button>\n    <x-button @click=\"modal4 = true\">不带页脚</x-button>\n    <x-modal v-model=\"modal2\">\n        <div

Events\n| 名字 | 描述 | 是否必选 |\n|-----|-----|----|\n|on-ok|点击确定的回调函数。回调函数如果返回真值(true)，则不再关闭对话框；如果返回假值(false)或不返回，则默认执行on-ok后关闭对话框|可选|\n|on-cancel|点击取消和右上角关闭的回调函数。回调函数如果返回真值(true)，则不再关闭对话框；如果返回假值(false)或不返回，则默认执行on-cancel后关闭对话框|可选|\n\n## Slot\n| 名字 | 描述 |\n|-----|-----|\n|header|自定义页头|\n|footer|自定义页脚内容|\n|close|自定义右上角关闭按钮|\n|-|对话框的主体内容|\n\n## Modal 全局方法\n\nXCUI为Modal提供了便捷的调用方式。在Vue.prototype中添加了快捷的方法：$Modal.show,$Modal.close, $confirm和$alert。因此，在Vue实例代码中，可以使用this.$Modal等方法快捷地创建一个对话框。\n但需要在调用这些全局方法之前，先在项目中引入XCUI或xcuiInstall，并调用Vue.use安装。\n\n完整引入XCUI：\n\n```js\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport XCUI from 'xcui' // 全局引入\nVue.use(XCUI)\n```\n\n做好以上准备工作后，即可在组件任何位置调用vm.$confirm等来隐式地创建一个对话框了。\n\n\n\n</template>\n<script>\nexport default {\n    data() {\n        return {\n            modal1: false,\n

通过在`x-input-number`元素中设置`v-model`属性绑定变量即可。绑定的变量值即为默认值。通过`@change`事件可以监听值的变化。通过键盘的`上下箭头键`也可改变输入框的值。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-input-number v-model=\"num1\" :min=\"1\" :max=\"10\" @change=\"handleChange\"></x-input-number>\n</tpl>\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                num1: 1\n            };\n        },\n        methods: {\n            handleChange(val, oldVal) {\n                console.log(`val: ${val}`);\n                console.log(`oldVal: ${oldVal}`);\n            }\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 禁用状态\n\n::: demo 设置`disabled`属性可以将计数器设置为禁用。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-input-number v-model=\"num2\" :min=\"1\" :max=\"10\" :disabled=\"true\"></x-input-number>\n</tpl>\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                num2: 1\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 步数\n\n::: demo 通过设置`step`属性可以定义递增/递减的步数。`step`可以设置为整数或小数。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-input-number v-model=\"num3\" :step=\"3\"></x-input-number>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                num3: 1\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 尺寸\n\n::: demo 额外提供了`large`, `small` 两种尺寸的输入框，通过设置`size`属性即可。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-input-number v-model=\"num4\" size=\"large\"></x-input-number>\n    <x-input-number v-model=\"num5\"></x-input-number>\n    <x-input-number v-model=\"num6\" size=\"small\"></x-input-number>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                num4: 1,\n                num5: 1,\n                num6: 1\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Props\n| 名字 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 | 是否必选

`success`, `warning`, `danger`，`dashed`，`link`。默认值为`default`。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button>default</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"primary\">primary</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"info\">info</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"success\">success</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"warning\">warning</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"danger\">danger</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"dashed\">dashed</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"link\">link</x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## 图标按钮\n\n::: demo 当需要在`Button` 内嵌入 `Icon` 时，可以设置 `icon` 属性，或者直接在 `Button` 内使用 `Icon` 组件。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button icon=\"search\"></x-button>\n    <x-button icon=\"edit\" type=\"primary\"></x-button>\n    <x-button icon=\"checkmark\" type=\"primary\"></x-button>\n    <x-button icon=\"plus-round\" type=\"primary\"></x-button>\n    <x-button icon=\"search\" type=\"info\"></x-button>\n    <x-button icon=\"search\" type=\"info\">搜索</x-button>\n    <x-button icon=\"archive\" type=\"success\">导出数据</x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 禁用状态\n\n::: demo 通过设置`disabled`属性可以将按钮置为禁用状态。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button :disabled=\"true\">主要按钮</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"primary\" :disabled=\"true\">主要按钮</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"dashed\" :disabled=\"true\">主要按钮</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"link\" :disabled=\"true\">主要按钮</x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 按钮尺寸\n\n::: demo 通过设置`size`属性可以设定按钮的大小。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button size=\"small\">小尺寸small</x-button>\n    <x-button>正常尺寸</x-button>\n    <x-button size=\"large\">大尺寸large</x-button>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 加载中状态\n\n::: demo 通过设置`loading`属性可以设定按钮进入加载中状态。最后两个按钮演示点击后进入加载状态。当进入加载状态时，`button` 的任何鼠标事件均**不会触发**。\n            \n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button size=\"small\" type=\"primary\" :loading=\"true\">Loading...</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"info\" :loading=\"true\">Loading...</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"primary\" :loading=\"isLoadingA\" @click=\"isLoadingA = true\">点击加载</x-button>\n    <x-button type=\"info\" icon=\"heart\" :loading=\"isLoadingB\" @click=\"isLoadingB = true\">{{isLoadingB ? '加载中...' : '点击加载'}}</x-button>\n</tpl>\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                isLoadingA: false\n                isLoadingB: false\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## 按钮组 \n\n::: demo 以按钮组的方式出现，常用于多项类似操作。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-button-group>\n        <x-button type=\"primary\" icon=\"chevron-left\">上一页</x-button>\n        <x-button type=\"primary\" icon=\"chevron-right\">下一页</x-button>\n    </x-button-group>\n    <x-button-group>\n        <x-button icon=\"refresh\" type=\"info\"></x-button>\n        <x-button icon=\"information\" type=\"info\"></x-button>\n        <x-button icon=\"edit\" type=\"info\"></x-button>\n    </x-button-group>\n    <x-button-group>\n        <x-button>Cancel</x-button>\n        <x-button type=\"info\">OK</x-button>\n    </x-button-group>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Props\n\n| 名字 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 | 是否必选

<x-col span=\"4\">\n            <x-input placeholder=\"Large Size\" v-model=\"input1\" size=\"large\"></x-input>\n        </x-col>\n        <x-col span=\"4\">\n            <x-input placeholder=\"Default Size\" v-model=\"input2\"></x-input>\n        </x-col>\n        <x-col span=\"4\">\n            <x-input placeholder=\"Small Size\" v-model=\"input3\" size=\"small\"></x-input>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## 带icon的输入框\n\n::: demo 通过设置`icon`属性，可以在输入框右边增加相应图标。点击图标会触发`click`事件。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col span=\"4\">\n            <x-input placeholder=\"请输入进行搜索\" icon=\"search\"></x-input>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 禁用状态\n\n::: demo 通过设置`disabled`属性可以将输入框置为禁用状态。在禁用状态下点击图标，不会触发`click`事件。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col span=\"4\">\n            <x-input :disabled=\"true\" placeholder=\"请输入内容\" icon=\"paper-airplane\"></x-input>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 复合型输入框\n\n::: demo 通过在`input`组件内部添加名为`prepend`和`append`的slot，可用于配置slot于配置一些特定组合的复合型输入框。\n\n```html\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col span=\"8\">\n            <x-input placeholder=\"请输入网址\">\n                <span slot=\"prepend\">http://</span>\n                <span slot=\"append\">.com</span>\n            </x-input>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n    <x-row style=\"margin-top: 15px\">\n        <x-col span=\"8\">\n            <x-input placeholder=\"请输入网址\">\n                <span slot=\"append\"><x-icon name=\"share\"></x-icon></span>\n            </x-input>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n    <x-row style=\"margin-top: 15px\">\n        <x-col span=\"8\">\n            <x-input placeholder=\"请输入网址\">\n                <x-select v-model=\"model\" slot=\"prepend\" placeholder=\"请选择\" style=\"width: 100px;\">\n                    <x-option v-for=\"item in options\" :key=\"item.key\" :value=\"item.value\"></x-option>\n                </x-select>\n                <span slot=\"append\"><x-icon name=\"share\"></x-icon></span>\n            </x-input>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Props\n| 名字 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 | 是否必选 |可选值|\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|\n|v-model|String,

最基本的用法，使用`<x-textarea>`标签即可创建一个输入框。使用`v-model`赋值。默认的`textarea`宽度是`100%`, 默认的行数是`2`。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\">\n            <x-textarea placeholder=\"请输入内容\" v-model=\"input\"></x-textarea>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 禁用状态\n\n::: demo 通过使用`disabled`属性可以设置禁用状态。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\">\n            <x-textarea placeholder=\"请输入内容\" v-model=\"input1\" :disabled=\"true\"></x-textarea>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 控制行数\n\n::: demo 通过使用`rows`属性可以控制`textarea`的行数。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\">\n            <x-textarea placeholder=\"请输入内容\" v-model=\"input2\" :rows=\"4\"></x-textarea>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## 自适应高度\n\n::: demo 通过使用`autosize`属性可以控制`textarea`组件进行高度自适应。可以设置为`Boolean(true, false)`或者一个指定了`minRows(最小行数)`, `maxRows（最大行数）`的`Object`。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-row :gutter=\"32\">\n        <x-col :span=\"8\">\n            <x-textarea placeholder=\"请输入内容\" v-model=\"input3\" :autosize=\"true\"></x-textarea>\n            <p>开启自适应高度</p>\n        </x-col>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\">\n            <x-textarea placeholder=\"请输入内容\" v-model=\"input4\" :autosize=\"{minRows: 2, maxRows: 4}\"></x-textarea>\n            <p>设置最小行数为2，最大行数为4</p>   \n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 显示当前输入长度及允许输入的范围\n\n::: demo 通过设置属性`maxlength`为一定数值，并设置属性`show-max`为`true`可以显示当前输入文字长度。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-row>\n        <x-col :span=\"8\">\n            <x-textarea placeholder=\"请输入内容\" v-model=\"input5\" :maxlength=\"15\" show-max></x-textarea>\n        </x-col>\n    </x-row>\n</tpl>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Props\n| 名字 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 | 是否必选

在`x-checkbox`中使用`v-model`绑定变量，默认绑定变量的值是`Boolean`, 选中时为`true`。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-checkbox v-model=\"checked0\">备选项</x-checkbox>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                checked0: false,\n            };\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 禁用状态\n\n::: demo 通过使用`disabled`属性可以设置多选框的禁用状态。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-checkbox v-model=\"checked2\" :disabled=\"true\">备选项</x-checkbox>\n    <x-checkbox v-model=\"checked3\" :disabled=\"true\">备选项</x-checkbox>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                checked2: true,\n                checked3: false\n            };\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 多选框组\n\n::: demo 通过将`x-checkbox`作为`x-checkbox-group`的直接子元素，可以建立组合的多选框。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-checkbox-group v-model=\"checklist\">\n        <x-checkbox value=\"未开始\">未开始</x-checkbox>\n        <x-checkbox value=\"进行中\">进行中</x-checkbox>\n        <x-checkbox value=\"已完成\">已完成</x-checkbox>\n        <x-checkbox value=\"已分配\" :disabled=\"true\">已分配</x-checkbox>\n        <x-checkbox value=\"已废弃\" :disabled=\"true\">已废弃</x-checkbox>\n    </x-checkbox-group>\n    <p style=\"margin-top: 15px;\">\n        选中的值数组： {{checklist}}\n    </p>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                checklist: ['已完成', '已分配']\n            };\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 全选和部分选中\n\n::: demo `indeterminate`属性表示多选框的不确定状态，常用于实现部分选中功能。本例实现了全选和部分选中功能。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-checkbox :indeterminate=\"indeterminate\" v-model=\"checkAll\" @change=\"handleCheckAll\">全选</x-checkbox>\n    <x-checkbox-group v-model=\"checkedRoles\" @change=\"handleCheckRole\" style=\"display:inline-block; margin-left: 15px;\">\n        <x-checkbox value=\"销售\">销售</x-checkbox>\n        <x-checkbox value=\"运营\">运营</x-checkbox>\n        <x-checkbox value=\"研发\">研发</x-checkbox>\n        <x-checkbox value=\"测试\">测试</x-checkbox>\n    </x-checkbox-group>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                checkedRoles: ['销售'],\n                indeterminate: true,\n                checkAll: false,\n                roleList: ['销售', '运营', '研发', '测试']\n            };\n        },\n        methods: {\n            handleCheckAll(e) {\n                this.checkedRoles = e.target.checked ? this.roleList : [];\n            },\n            handleCheckRole(val) {\n                let count = val.length;\n                this.checkAll = count === this.roleList.length;\n                this.indeterminate = count > 0 && count < this.roleList.length;\n            }\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## Checkbox Props\n| 名字 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 | 是否必选

所有选项默认可见，方便用户在比较中选择，因此选项不宜过多。\n\n\n## 基础用法\n\n::: demo 最简单的用法。通过设置`v-model`值和`label`属性为相应的变量。选中时`v-model`的值变为该`radio`组件的`label`值。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-radio v-model=\"checked\" label=\"1\">备选项1</x-radio>\n    <x-radio v-model=\"checked\" label=\"2\">备选项2</x-radio>\n    <p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">选中的值：{{checked}}</p>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                checked: '1'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 禁用状态\n\n::: demo 通过使用`disabled`属性可以设置单选框的禁用状态。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-radio v-model=\"checked1\" :disabled=\"true\" label=\"1\">备选项1</x-radio>\n    <x-radio v-model=\"checked1\" :disabled=\"true\" label=\"2\">备选项2</x-radio>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                checked1: '1'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 单选框组\n\n\n::: demo 一组互斥的单选框配合使用。这种情况下无需再设置单个`radio`的`v-model`属性。当相应的`radio`被选中时，`radio-group`的`v-model`值随之改变。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-radio-group v-model=\"checked3\">\n        <x-radio label=\"1\">备选项1</x-radio>\n        <x-radio label=\"2\">备选项2</x-radio>\n        <x-radio label=\"3\">备选项3</x-radio>\n    </x-radio-group>\n    <p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">选中的值：{{checked3}}</p>   \n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                checked3: '1'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n## 按钮样式\n\n::: demo 按钮样式的单选框组合。通过引入`radio-group`和`radio-button`组件来实现。此时无需再设置单个`radio-button`的`v-model`属性。当相应的`radio`被选中时，`radio-group`的`v-model`值随之改变。通过`size`来可以控制大小。除默认大小外，提供`large`和`small`两种大小。\n\n```html\n\n<tpl>\n    <x-radio-group v-model=\"checked4\">\n        <x-radio-button label=\"1\">备选项1</x-radio-button>\n        <x-radio-button label=\"2\">备选项2</x-radio-button>\n        <x-radio-button label=\"3\">备选项3</x-radio-button>\n    </x-radio-group>\n    <p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">选中的值：{{checked4}}</p>\n</tpl>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data() {\n            return {\n                checked4: '1'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## Radio Props\n\n| 名字 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 | 是否必选 |可选值|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|label|String, Number, Boolean|无|Radio的 `value`|必选||\n|disabled|Boolean|false|禁用状态|可选|`true`, `false`|\n\n## Radio-group Props\n\n| 名字 | 类型 | 默认 | 描述 | 是否必选
